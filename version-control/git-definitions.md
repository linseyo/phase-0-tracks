# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is what allows us to look at previous revisions done on a file as well as merge together revisions that are made by different people at different times. It is useful because if there is any problems with any changes done we are able to see the previous versions or previous changes. As well as see who made those changes and see who contributed what parts to a docment.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of your project that allows you to make changes that can then be merged in the master. Branches would be used to be worked on that then get merged into the master. Using branches allow you make changes that won't interfere with what other people are working on as well as making individual changes that can later be implemented or removed. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is producing a type of save point for the project. This save point can be revisited at a later point if needed. A good commit message describes in detail what the change was since the last commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there is a change to the same file done by multiple people producing conflict in which Git is unable to distinguish which merge change to commit to.
