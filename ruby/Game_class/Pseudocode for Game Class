Pseudocode for Game Class

Create a Game where:
User 1 enters a word
User 2 attempts to guess the word


Input: Word 
Input: Letters

Guesses are limited --> based on the length of the word
	(i.e: word is SOCK, user gets 4 guesses)
	guesses = word.length
	If does not guess in .length amount of guesses --> LOSE
		Use LOSE print Method
	If does guess --> WIN
		Use WIN print Method 

	**Repeated guesses do not count against user
		(i.e: if user guesses the letter "P" twice, it will only count as 1 guess)

User 2 recieves update on the current state of the word during each guess
	Input: guessed letters
	(think hang-man & being able to see which letters you've already guessed & how many more letters you need to guess)
	After each guess, print out the current state of the word
	Output: Use _ to represent letters that have not been guessed (_ _ x _ o _)



End with a congratulatory message if WIN
End with a taunting message is LOSE
