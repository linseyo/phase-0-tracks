		This Hawaiian word is used when greeting or parting from someone. There is a deeper meaning to the word Aloha and it is often described as "the spirit of aloha" </p>
		<br>
		Let's see some ways this is used:
		<ol>
			<li>The Aloha Spirit</li>
			<li>The Way of Aloha</li>
			</ol>
		<br>
		But what does <strong>ALOHA</strong> really mean?
		<br>
		It can be broken down by letters or by phrases. Growing up children in Hawai'i often learn the "fundamental code of ethics" which is often found in the word Aloha.
		<ul>
			<li><b>A</b>, ala, watchful, alterness</li>
			<li><b>L</b>, lokahi, working with unity</li>
			<li><b>O</b>, oia'i'o, truthful honesty</li>
