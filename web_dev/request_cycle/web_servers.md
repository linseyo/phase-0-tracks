1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
...Some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system are that it never assumes the user is incompetent and that it allows you to do anything you tell it to. It gives the user the maximum amount of capabilities as opposed to other system. In essence the Linux OS assumes that the user knows what they are doing and gives them free reign with options for various tools but does not short stop the user from doing what it is they want. 



2. In your own words, what is VPS (virtual private server?) What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
...Essentially VPS are VMs that have been put onto large scale and rented out for consumer use. They are the same as VMs (virtual machines), in that they run an emulated version of a computer by using the physical resources of a computer such as the RAM and CPU. 


3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
...Running programs as the root user could let you fall into a serious problem. If you are running programs or applications that are buggy they could result in detrimental damage to your system because as the root user you are giving these programs the ability to access everything under the sun on your system. In order to control and limit the damage, it is recommended not to logon as the root user. This way you can only make changes and modify your system with the root user permission. This is a security feature and limits the potential for serious damage.
